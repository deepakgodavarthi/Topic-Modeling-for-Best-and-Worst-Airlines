# Topic-Modeling-for-Best-and-Worst-Airlines

We will first convert the field `airline sentiment" to numeric so that we can find the average sentiment for each
airline. We will use a conversion scheme as follows:
Sentiment Numeric Value

Positive 5.0

Neutral 2.5

Negative 1.0

Using the above scheme, we will calculate the average rating for each airline, and then figure out
which are the best and worst in terms of average ratings. If there is a tie, we can choose any one at
random. You will then do topic modeling on these two airlines using the \text" field, with the stop
words removed. We are free to choose the number of topics (clusters). Finally, we will write the
output to the second argument specified in the command line.
The arguments for this class would be: input data file, and output folder.
